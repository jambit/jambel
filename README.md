jambel
======

three color signal light for monitoring software build status


Getting started
---------------
The project is built with [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/). Use the commited Gradle wrapper script to obtain Gradle. Type `./gradlew tasks` to get an overview of executable Gradle tasks. The task `distZip` is used to build a ZIP file that can be distributed.


Configuration
-------------
The file `/etc/jambel.json` is used for configuring the Jambel. All jobs that are mapped onto this Jambel are listed in `jobs`. The signal light configuration includes the following items:
- the position of the green light (`top` vs. `bottom`)
- the host and port of the signal light
- the timeout that is used when waiting for a reply and upon establishing a TCP connection
- the port of the web interface can be configured
- polling mode and polling interval (web interface is deactivated when using polling mode)

Web UI
------
The web interface of the Jambel can be found at `http://<HOSTNAME>:<HTTP-PORT>/web/`. It can be used to see the last statuses of the jobs, the last sent configuration of the signal light and to reset the signal light.


TODO
----
Here is a list of ideas what to improve:
- control multiple signal lights and offer a flexible configuration from jobs to signal lights
- WebSocket for web UI to monitor the build status in the browser in real time
- retry sending signal light command after 5 seconds when connection was refused upon the first try (happens from time to time)
- set up application task of Gradle to generate start scripts for a daemon process (maybe using http://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.application.CreateStartScripts.html)
